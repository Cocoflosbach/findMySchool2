# findMySchool_api

## Project Description

This is a REST API for an application called ‚ÄúfindMySchool‚Äù that interacts with a database that stores data about different creches and kindergartens in Lagos, Nigeria. This app will allow parents of toddlers find the most suitable school for their children by providing access to information such as school listings, tuition range and contact details of their choice of preference.

It will consist of a well-designed REST API and architected database built using JavaScript, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. The REST API will be accessed via commonly used HTTP methods like GET and POST. Similar methods (CRUD) will be used to retrieve data from the database and store that data in a non-relational way.
